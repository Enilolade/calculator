## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript (DOM manipulation)
- LocalStorage for theme persistence

### What I learned

I gained a better understanding of how to:

- Use Tailwind CSS to create responsive layouts and style UI components efficiently.
- Manage state transitions like theme switching using JavaScript.

### Continued development

I'd like to continue improving my JavaScript logic for evaluating expressions more safely and efficiently. In future projects, I also plan to explore using a JavaScript framework (like React) for better state management.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) - Helped a lot in creating responsive and theme-based styling.
